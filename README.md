# Login form project

Project in Action - [Loginform](https://basic-login-3h1f.onrender.com)

## Inspired

I have watched node js tutorial by Dave Gray - [NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EqECiTBL8&t=107s)
I also have watched react-auth tutorial - [ReactAuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brcHK3P6ChQ&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PRCpm9clX0WiBEMB70FWwd)

Most of the principles were taken from these tutorials.
